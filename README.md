# Compressional-travel-time-DTC-and-shear-travel-time-DTS-logs-prediction-in-well-logs-

Well logs are interpreted to estimate the petrophysical and geomechanical properties, which is essential for subsurface characterization. Various types of logs exist, and each provides distinct information about subsurface properties. Compressional travel-time (DTC) and shear travel-time (DTS) logs are not acquired in all the wells drilled in a field due to operational constraints. Under such circumstances, my machine learning modelcan be used to predict DTC and DTS logs to improve subsurface characterization. My goal was to develop data-driven models by processing  conventional logs from a Well  and use my data-driven model to generate synthetic compressional and shear travel-time logs (DTC and DTS, respectively) in another Well. My robust data-driven model for the desired sonic-log synthesis results in low prediction errors, which can be quantified in terms of Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) by comparing the synthesized and the original DTC and DTS logs.
